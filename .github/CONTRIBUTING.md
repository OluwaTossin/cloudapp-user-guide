# Contributing to CloudApp Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the content creation workflow, style guidelines, and technical standards for maintaining high-quality technical documentation. These processes ensure consistency, accessibility, and user-centered content.

## Content Strategy

### Documentation Principles

1. **User-Centered Design**: All content starts with user research and task analysis
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information layered from basic to advanced concepts
3. **Scannable Format**: Headings, bullets, and visual hierarchy for easy scanning
4. **Actionable Content**: Every procedure includes clear steps and expected outcomes
5. **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive design

### Target Audiences

**Primary Users**:
- Business professionals new to CloudApp
- Team leads implementing collaboration tools
- IT administrators managing organizational rollouts

**Secondary Users**:
- Power users seeking advanced functionality
- Developers integrating CloudApp APIs
- Support teams troubleshooting user issues

## Writing Process

### Content Planning Phase

1. **User Story Creation**
   - Define user goals and context
   - Identify pain points and success criteria
   - Map content to user journey stages

2. **Information Architecture**
   - Organize content by user workflow
   - Create logical navigation paths
   - Plan cross-references and related links

3. **Content Audit**
   - Review existing content for gaps
   - Identify redundancies or conflicts
   - Plan content migration and updates

### Content Creation Workflow

#### Step 1: Research and Planning (30% of time)
- **User Research**: Survey feedback, support tickets, analytics data
- **Subject Matter Expert (SME) Interviews**: Product teams, support, sales
- **Competitive Analysis**: Review industry best practices and standards
- **Technical Review**: Verify accuracy with development teams

#### Step 2: Writing and Structure (50% of time)
- **Outline Creation**: Hierarchical content structure with clear sections
- **First Draft**: Focus on complete information coverage
- **Content Review**: Self-edit for clarity, accuracy, and completeness
- **Technical Accuracy**: Verify all procedures and screenshots

#### Step 3: Review and Refinement (20% of time)
- **Editorial Review**: Grammar, style, and consistency check
- **User Testing**: Test procedures with actual users when possible
- **Stakeholder Review**: SME approval for technical accuracy
- **Final Polish**: Formatting, links, and accessibility compliance

## Style Guide Standards

### Voice and Tone

**Voice Characteristics**:
- **Professional yet approachable**: Authoritative without being intimidating
- **Clear and concise**: Direct language that respects user time
- **Helpful and supportive**: Assumes positive intent and provides solutions
- **Consistent terminology**: Same words for same concepts throughout

**Tone Variations by Content Type**:
- **Getting Started**: Encouraging and confidence-building
- **Procedures**: Direct and action-oriented
- **Troubleshooting**: Calm and solution-focused
- **Advanced Features**: Informative and detailed

### Writing Guidelines

#### Headings and Structure
```markdown
# H1: Page Title (Title Case, One per Page)
## H2: Major Section (Title Case)
### H3: Subsection (Title Case)
#### H4: Minor Section (Title Case, Limit Use)
```

#### Lists and Procedures
**Ordered Lists**: Use for sequential steps
```markdown
1. First action with clear verb
2. Second action with expected result
3. Final step with success indicator
```

**Unordered Lists**: Use for non-sequential information
```markdown
- Feature or characteristic
- Related concept or option
- Additional consideration
```

#### Code and UI Elements
- **Menu Items**: Bold formatting (`**File** > **Save**`)
- **Button Text**: Bold formatting (`Click **Submit**`)
- **Code Snippets**: Code blocks with language specification
- **File Names**: Code formatting (`README.md`)
- **URLs**: Descriptive link text, not raw URLs

### Content Formatting Standards

#### Images and Media
- **Alt Text**: Descriptive alternative text for all images
- **Captions**: Figure numbers and descriptive captions
- **File Naming**: Descriptive names with consistent conventions
- **Optimization**: Web-optimized file sizes and formats

#### Tables
```markdown
| Column Header | Another Header | Third Header |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| Cell content  | Cell content   | Cell content |
| Aligned left  | Centered data  | Right align  |
```

**Table Guidelines**:
- Use for comparative data or structured information
- Include headers for screen reader accessibility
- Keep content concise within cells
- Consider responsive design for mobile viewing

#### Callouts and Alerts
```markdown
> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Advanced technique or efficiency improvement

> ⚠️ **Important**: Critical information or warnings

> 📝 **Note**: Additional context or clarification
```
