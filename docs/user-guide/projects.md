- **Solution**: Use version comparison tools and merge conflicts manually
- **Prevention**: Implement file check-out system for critical documents

### Performance Optimization

**Large Project Management**:
- Archive completed project phases to improve loading times
- Use folder organization to limit visible file counts
- Implement file naming standards for easy searching
- Regular cleanup of duplicate and outdated files

**Team Coordination**:
