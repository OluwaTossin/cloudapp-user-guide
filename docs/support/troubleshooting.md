## üîß Common Technical Issues

### File Upload Problems

**Issue 1: Upload Fails Completely**

| Possible Cause | Solution |
|----------------|----------|
| File too large (>100MB) | Split large files or use cloud storage integration |
| Unsupported file type | Check [supported formats](../user-guide/files.md#supported-formats) |
| Network timeout | Try smaller batches, check internet stability |
| Browser compatibility | Update browser or try different browser |

**Issue 2: Upload Starts But Never Completes**

**Step-by-Step Resolution**:
1. **Check Upload Progress**
   - Look for progress indicator
   - Note any error messages
   - Check available storage space

2. **Network Diagnostics**
   - Test internet speed: [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net)
   - Try wired connection if using WiFi
   - Disable VPN temporarily

3. **Browser Troubleshooting**
   - Disable extensions one by one
   - Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows) / Cmd+Shift+Delete (Mac)
   - Try incognito/private mode

4. **Alternative Methods**
   - Use drag-and-drop instead of file picker
   - Try uploading single files instead of batches
   - Use mobile app as alternative

### Sync and Collaboration Issues

**Real-Time Editing Not Working**

**Diagnostic Questions**:
- Are all collaborators using supported browsers?
- Is anyone working offline?
- Are you editing the same file section simultaneously?

**Resolution Steps**:
1. **Refresh All Browser Windows**
   - Press F5 or Ctrl+R to refresh
   - Ensure all team members refresh simultaneously
   
2. **Check Browser Compatibility**
   - Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
   - Disable conflicting extensions (ad blockers, privacy tools)
   
3. **Network Requirements**
   - Stable internet connection (5+ Mbps recommended)
   - WebSocket connections enabled (not blocked by firewall)
   
4. **Clear Conflict Resolution**
   - Save individual changes before syncing
   - Use "Resolve Conflicts" tool in file menu
   - Coordinate editing schedules for complex documents

## üîê Permission and Access Issues

### "Access Denied" Errors

**Common Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1**: Recently invited team member can't access project
- **Check**: Email invitation status in project settings
- **Verify**: Correct email address used for invitation
- **Resolve**: Resend invitation or add member manually

**Scenario 2**: Previously accessible content now restricted
- **Check**: Recent permission changes in project settings
- **Verify**: Your role hasn't changed (contact project owner)
- **Resolve**: Request permission restoration

**Scenario 3**: Integration permissions revoked
- **Check**: Third-party service (Google, Dropbox) authorization
- **Verify**: CloudApp still has necessary permissions
- **Resolve**: Re-authorize integration in Settings > Integrations

### Team Management Problems

**Cannot Add Team Members**

1. **Verify Account Limits**
   - Check current team size against plan limits
